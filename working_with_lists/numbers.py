
##Making Numerical Lists

for value in range(1,5):  #it wouldn't print number 5
	print(value)
#1
#2
#3
#4
 
##Using range() to Make a List of Numbers
numbers = list(range(1,6))
print(numbers)
#[1,2,3,4,5]

print(list(range(1,3))) # you can use inside print but it is not a variable or saved list
#[1,2]
